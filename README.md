# Spectri

A tool for creating beautiful, paper-esque websites and PWAs from MD/MDX
sources.

## Mission

The purpose of this tool is to bridge the gap between LaTeX and Markdown (or
MDX) for the purpose of writing specification documents. Spec documents are
about the content, and Spectri aims to remove the cognitive load of formatting
and typesetting so writers don't need to think so much about the output format
(Web, PDF, physical paper).

## Technologies

Spectri is built using Gatsby, Emotion, and MDX.
